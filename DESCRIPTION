Description: Model-based assessment of attribute inference risk in
    synthetic microdata. RAPID simulates sophisticated attacker
    capabilities using machine learning models and provides record-level
    risk scores with baseline-corrected metrics for both categorical and
    continuous sensitive attributes.
