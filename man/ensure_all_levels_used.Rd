\title{Ensure Factor Levels Are Preserved for Model Fitting}
\usage{
ensure_all_levels_used(synthetic_data, original_data, sensitive_attribute)
}
\arguments{
\item{synthetic_data}{A synthetic dataset (data frame).}

\item{original_data}{The original dataset (data frame).}

\item{sensitive_attribute}{The name (character string) of the sensitive variable (must be a factor).}
}
\value{
A modified version of \code{synthetic_data} with dummy rows added if necessary to ensure
        the `"missing"` level is preserved.
}
\description{
This helper function ensures that all levels of the sensitive attribute in the original data—
including `"missing"` if it exists—are also present in the synthetic data. This prevents
model training functions (e.g., random forest or logistic regression) from silently dropping
levels that are absent in the synthetic dataset but exist in the original, particularly when
dealing with factor variables.

If the `"missing"` level exists in \code{original_data[[sensitive_attribute]]} but is not present in
\code{synth[[sensitive_attribute]]}, the function adds a small number of dummy rows with that level
to the synthetic data to ensure consistency.

\examples{
set.seed(42)
original_data <- data.frame(sensitive = factor(c("A", "B", "missing")),
                    x = 1:3)
synthetic_data <- data.frame(sensitive = factor(c("A", "B")),
                    x = 10:11)
synthetic_data_new <- ensure_all_levels_used(synthetic_data, original_data, "sensitive")

levels(synthetic_data_new$sensitive)  # includes "missing"
table(synthetic_data_new$sensitive)
